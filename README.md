# optitrack_benchmarking_utils

General Use:

1. To record both Optitrack data and image captures simultaneously, use bm_record.

2. To localize frames from a bm_record session, use bm_localize.

3. To compare the results from each, use bm_align.

4. If quaternions are undesirable, use bm_quat_to_euler.
